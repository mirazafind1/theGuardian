        <h1>An Electric Future for Paris? </h1>
    

        <p>By now, most would agree that electric vehicles are essential in the effort to reduce fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emissions responsible for threatening worldwide climate change. Huge presence: in air pollution and global warming (CO2). <br><br>
            However, this problem is actually good news for the French electric car industry with a rise in demand for eco friendly automobiles as people become more environmentally conscious.
            In this article, we will focus on Paris (department 75) and examine the evolution of electric mobility between 2022 and 2024.
            Using mathematical analysis, we will present our forecasts for the coming years.
            Could this be the start of a revolution in electric mobility, leading to a more sustainable future for the capital?
        </p>

        <h3>The rise of electric vehicles in Paris</h3>
        <p>In 2022, there were 37,733 electric vehicles, a number that doubled to 75,655 in 2024. This rapid growth reflects a real success in achieving our environmental objectives.</p>

        <br><br><br>
        <div id="svg-pourcentages"></div>

        <p>In 2022, electric vehicles accounted for only 3.9% of cars on the road in Paris. This number increased to 4.4% in 2023 and reached 6.3% in 2024. This progression illustrates a fast adoption, even though the total number of vehicles remained stable during this period. <br>

            In 2024, the average daily number of electric cars on the road will be 3,290, compared with a total of 52,460 vehicles. This steady increase since 2022 shows that Parisians are increasingly opting for electric vehicles, despite a stable overall number of vehicles. This trend reflects a real change in behaviour.
        </p>

        <h3>Uneven electric vehicle uptake in Paris</h3>
        <p>The quartiles show that electric vehicle adoption in Paris is not the same everywhere. In 2024, there is a big difference, with 4,547 electric cars in the top quartile and only 1,071 in the bottom quartile. This difference might be because of access to charging stations and different transportation priorities.</p>

        <br><br>


        <p>In 2024, the standard deviation for electric cars is 3,474, which means there is a lot of difference between the districts. Some districts have many more electric vehicles than others. However, the standard deviation for total vehicles stays steady at 39,726, showing a more even distribution . Most districts have a similar number of vehicles, while others have many electric vehicles, showing an imbalance. Some districts are moving quickly to electric vehicles, while others are still behind.
        </p>

        <h3>What about the years to come?</h3>
        <p>When we look at the growth rates of electric vehicles and total vehicles in Paris from 2022 to 2024, we see big differences. From 2023 to 2024, the growth rate for electric vehicles is 45.14%, while the growth rate for electric vehicles is only 4.70%. This shows that Parisians are becoming more interested in electric vehicles.

            Based on average growth rates, it is possible to predict future trends. There will be 107,158 electric vehicles on the road in 2025 rising to 151,781 in 2026. This number could reach 2 14 985 in 2027 and 3 04 509 by the next year. This progression should follow a similar trajectory in 2029 and 2030 with projections of around 431,311 and 610,915 electric vehicles on the road.
            
            The same trajectory is expected to play out in 2029 and 2030, with estimates for the number of electric vehicles on the roads at around 431,311, then more than double this figure by hitting an estimated 610,915 in the following year.

        These projections show a big change in how people get around in Paris, with more and more electric vehicles compared to a much smaller rise in traditional vehicles.
